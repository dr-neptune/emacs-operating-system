#+TITLE: Emacs Operating System 🚀
#+AUTHOR: Neptune

This repository holds my personal Emacs configuration and any small
Emacs Lisp tools I write. My goal is to craft a cohesive, portable,
and minimal Emacs “OS” that I can share across multiple machines and
operating systems. Feel free to explore and adapt.
